1. Version control is 
its important because 
2. Git is the actual coding that you use to run with github. Github is a website that people can use to create different repositories and databases. They can share and use other peoples repostitories by forking or cloing. 
3. The git workflow is that you create a file and the you edit it, then you add it to git hub, then you commit it to 
github, then you create the repository on Github and push all your work onto that repository.
4. You use a branch when you dont want to make any changes to the original code you just want to add onto it. You would also 
use branching when there are alot of people working on one project. 
5. Forking copies the repository and you can make edits and changes to it then make a pull request to ask the creator to change things they orignally had on the repsoitory. Cloning it makes a copy of everything and you dont make any pull requests or send any changes back to the original creator. 
6. You would use git remote -v because 


7. Some of the tables dont have primary keys or foreign keys and some of the tables dont have the columns properly labeled
they should all have what kind of character they are such as varchar, int, numberic.
8. In the location table there is not primary key connecting the students table or the course table. So if you wanted to run 
a SQL query to see which students had classes in what builiding you wouldnt have anything to connect them on.
9. CREATE TABLE gradutaion (
    student_id int UNIQUE FOREIGN KEY
    graduation_year int
    gpa numberic
    courses_completed int
);
